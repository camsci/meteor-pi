<h3>Is it a bird... is it a plane?</h3>

            Not all the videos contain real moving objects. Sometimes the cameras trigger because of twinkling stars or
            video
            artifacts.
            Look through until you find a video that shows a moving object. The next challenge is to work out what it
            is.
            Meteor Pi cameras pick up large numbers of satellites and planes, as well as meteors.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Meteors are distinctive, because they move much more quickly than planes and satellites, at speeds of over
            10
            kilometres each second. They are
            usually only visible for a fraction of a second as they burn up. To find more meteors, you may want change
            the "Max
            duration" field to one second and repeat your search.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Planes are often easy to spot because they have flashing lights. They are usually visible for 10-30 seconds,
            whereas
            meteors are gone in a fraction of a second. If you set the "Min duration" field to 10 or 20 seconds, most of
            the
            objects you'll see will be planes.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Satellites, like planes, are visible for much longer than meteors &ndash; at least 10-30 seconds. They move
            at a
            steady speed and they don't have flashing lights.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            The flight paths of satellites are extremely predictable, and so if you think you've found one, you can try
            looking
            on a website like <a href="https://in-the-sky.org/satpasses.php">In-The-Sky.org</a> to see if you can track
            down
            which satellite it was.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            Alternatively, why not look up which satellites flew over the UK last night, and see if any Meteor Pi
            cameras picked
            them up?

            Once you've started looking at Meteor Pi images, you'll want to know what else you can see!
