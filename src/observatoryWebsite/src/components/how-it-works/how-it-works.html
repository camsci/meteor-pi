<h2>How Meteor Pi Works</h2>

<p class="text">
    The night sky is an awe-inspiring sight. The ability to see objects that are billions of kilometres away. The
    patterns of stars, which have remained unchanged for thousands of years and would have been perfectly recognisable
    to our distant ancestors. The wonderous question of whether there might be other planets out there, with somebody
    looking back at us.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Meteor Pi makes the night sky a lot more accessible. To see it for real, you need to go out to a dark place, late at
    night. We've installed cameras which take pictures all through the night, which you can browse at whatever time is
    convenient.
</p>

<p class="text">
    As well as taking still pictures through the night, our cameras are also motion sensitive, snapping pictures of any
    planes, satellites, meteors or other unidentified objects that fly over!
</p>

<h3>What do the cameras look like?</h3>

    <b>Meteor Pi cameras are similar to CCTV cameras, but they point upwards at the sky!</b>

<p class="text">
    Each Meteor Pi camera looks very much like a CCTV camera you might see in the street. The most obvious difference is
    that ours point upwards at the sky.
    There’s also a lot of electronics packed inside each Meteor Pi observatory.
</p><p class="text">
    The camera we use is a Watec 902H2 Ultimate &ndash; a Japanese CCTV camera which is designed to work in incredibly
    dark
    places. These cameras need only look at
    the sky for a few seconds to detect stars hundreds of times fainter than the human eye can see.
</p><p class="text">
    Also in the box is a Raspberry Pi computer, which analyses the pictures to look for moving objects. A
    GPS receiver records the observatory’s exact location, and tells the Raspberry Pi exactly what the time is.

<p class="text">
    At around lunchtime each day, each observatory transmits all the video clips of the moving objects it has seen to
    this website.
    It also transmits a series of still images, taken at one-minute intervals through the night, allowing you to call up
    a picture
    of how the night sky appeared at any given time.
