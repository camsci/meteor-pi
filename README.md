# Meteor Pi

Meteor Pi is a project to make it really easy for schools, community groups, and enthusiasts to observe the night sky.

We're installing CCTV cameras around the east of England that point upwards and record pictures throughout the hours of darkness. All of the images we record are freely available from the [Meteor Pi website](http://meteorpi.cambridgesciencecentre.org/).

Our cameras record still photos every 30 seconds, allowing you to spot the constellations, see the rotation of the stars through the night, and track the gradual movement of the planets.

They are also motion sensitive, storing video clips of any planes, satellites and shooting stars that pass overhead.

Our geographically distributed network of cameras allow the altitudes of some of these objects to be triangulated. If the International Space Station is observed by multiple cameras 50 miles apart, it appears in slightly different parts of the sky, and from that information it's quite easy to calculate the ISS's altitude.

## Our GitHub website

To access our data, or to find out about educational activities, please visit the [Meteor Pi website](http://meteorpi.cambridgesciencecentre.org/).

These GitHub pages are a repository for technical information about the project.

Here you can learn about how to build your own Meteor Pi camera, the software that's needed to control it, and how you can help improve the prohect.

## Our supporters

Meteor Pi was developed by [Cambridge Science Centre](http://www.cambridgesciencecentre.org/), with generous support from the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), and [MathWorks](http://uk.mathworks.com).

## Audience

Meteor Pi is open to all. Although many of our activities have been developed with children in mind, all of our data is open for anyone to access. You can find instructions here for building your own camera, and we'd be delighted to hear how you get on. We're especially keen to work with amateur astronomers who would like to use our cameras to make scientific observations of meteors, for example as part of the [NEMETODE](http://www.nemetode.org) and [UKMON](http://www.ukmeteornetwork.co.uk) networks.
