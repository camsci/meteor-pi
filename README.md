# Meteor Pi

MeteorPi is a project, run from the [http://www.cambridgesciencecentre.org/](Cambridge Science Centre), producing a network of small, low cost internet enabled observatories and their accompanying software.

## Meteors

As the name suggests, this phase of the project is focused on watching the night skies for meteors (as well as other objects such as the ISS and any passing spy satellites!). Each camera contains a black and white security camera, a Raspberry Pi 2 and some local storage. A full stack from image processing through data storage and exposure through a REST API runs on the Pi, and we've created both a rich web UI and a Python client library to connect to and query the information the system captures. 

## Audience

We're building the MeteorPi cameras to be installed in schools and homes, for those with an interest in astronomy, an interest in learning about data science and those who are just plain curious.
